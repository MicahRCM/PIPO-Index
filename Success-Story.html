                <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Early Fall 2020 and I opened my daily e-mail news summary from the Chronicle of Higher Education to find that someone had finally solved the retention/graduation/persistence problem! &nbsp;Who was it? What did they do? &nbsp;Always on the lookout for exemplar schools, I rushed to click and read the story, wondering what combination of interventions the school had put in place that had made the difference. &nbsp;The answer, according to the article at least, was a new peer-advising system. &nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Thunk. &nbsp;That didn&rsquo;t sound too promising to me. &nbsp;For one, peer advising systems are not exactly a new idea. &nbsp;I ran one at Ohio State 30 years ago and the idea had been around a long time before that. &nbsp;Furthermore, lots of schools have peer-advising systems and so it didn&rsquo;t seem like this was likely to be a difference maker. &nbsp;If there had been improvement, I suspected something else was responsible. &nbsp;I was guessing that there had been some changes in the student body that accounted for the difference, most particularly, in the SAT/ACT scores of the incoming classes. &nbsp;I decided to investigate. &nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The article on the school in question, Southern Utah University, starts by telling the story of a couple of administrators who called students who had left the university trying to understand why they&rsquo;d departed. &nbsp;That was worth doing because although SUU had been on a long and relatively steady upward trend in its retention rate, averaging a bit under a point of improvement each year over the past decade, it was still losing around 35% of its students at the end of the first year and way behind its peer institutions. &nbsp;The problem was even more acute after the second year as only about 40% of its students were graduating in 6 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The problem was perceived and painted as a gen-Z problem, a group who need more outreach than students in the past. &nbsp;They were not going to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m struggling. Can you help me?&rdquo; according to the Vice President for Student Affairs. &nbsp;But students in trouble have always had trouble uttering those words and that this clearly wasn&rsquo;t a new gen-Z problem for SUU, as their persistence record problems extends back decades. It seemed to me that they maybe they hadn&rsquo;t gotten the diagnosis right, and so the medicine probably wasn&rsquo;t going to help. &nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Second, the medicine itself seemed implausibly weak. &nbsp;The program assigned all incoming students to paid peer mentors, 120 students to a mentor. &nbsp;I hate to get down on these people&rsquo;s well-intentioned efforts, but an undergraduate student mentor has a case load of 120 students? &nbsp;Unless the university is abusing them, they probably have 15 hours or so a week to devote to interacting with their mentees. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s less than 10 minutes a week per student. &nbsp;They&rsquo;d probably spend more time than that just tracking down the student to get in touch. &nbsp;They also sent text messages. &nbsp;But a text message having a substantial impact on a student struggling with finances, family problems, or poor academic preparation? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s magical thinking. &nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">If it wasn&rsquo;t that though, what might be responsible for the improvement? &nbsp;When we look at the data, we find out that for once, the SAT scores weren&rsquo;t the primary driver. &nbsp;There has been slight improvement over the years mentioned in the article (2014-2019), but nowhere near enough to account for the upward trend in their retention rate. &nbsp; The same thing with the other markers of AQ: High School GPA, % of students in the top ten % of their high school class. &nbsp;All basically steady and unlikely to have had any marked effect on the persistence of the student body. &nbsp;Compositional factors also appear to have largely been steady. &nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">So, what has been changing at SUU? &nbsp;Well, the first thing to notice is that size of the student population has been growing radically. &nbsp;Over the relatively short period in question, the size of the first-year class more than doubled! &nbsp;One way they did this, however, was by lowering the bar for admissions. &nbsp;At one point in time, it was relatively difficult to get into SUU. &nbsp;In 2013, the acceptance rate bottomed out at 57%. &nbsp;This past year is had grown to 79%--4 out of every 5 students who applied to SUU were accepted. &nbsp;But neither class size nor acceptance rate suggests any particular advantage when it comes to retention (it&rsquo;s noteworthy, however, that they kept their AQ markers steady while growing so rapidly). &nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">But there was another change that does matter: the way financial aid was distributed. &nbsp;In particular, SUU shifted aid toward needy students. &nbsp;The average aid award to students did not increase, but how it was distributed changed a lot. &nbsp;For example, in 2014, the percent of student at SUU who had their full need met was very low&mdash;only 1.4%. &nbsp;That meant a lot of students were attending without the resources they really needed to get through school. &nbsp;In 2019, that number was up to 21.6%! &nbsp;That is a huge turnaround and meant that a lot more students were actually equipped with the money they needed to keep going at SUU. &nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">We can see this in a different way when we look at merit-based aid versus need-based aid. &nbsp;In 2014, the average merit-based scholarship at SUU was more than twice as big as the average need-based award (2.1 times as high, to be exact). &nbsp;Only one year later, the average need-based scholarship was slightly lower, but the merit-based scholarship had dropped 36%, such that the ratio of merit to need award was about 1.4%. &nbsp;That approximate ratio has continued since then and no doubt is helping many more of its growing student body get to that &ldquo;need-met&rdquo; status. &nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">So, SUU has done something good and laudable that is beyond PIPO and beyond manipulating composition. &nbsp;And I congratulate them and their leadership for addressing a critical issue&mdash;financial need---that challenges student&rsquo;s ability to persist in pursuit of their higher education goals. &nbsp;It is a story of improvement in many ways, and they are definitely making progress. But the struggle is long and tough. &nbsp;Even with recent improvements, their latest 6-year graduation rate is still just over 40% and their retention rate is approaching 70%. &nbsp;Both of those values, even though they are improved over the past, are underperforming relative to privilege peers. &nbsp;I look forward to watching their efforts&mdash;and I hope continued progress&mdash;over the next few years.</span></p>
